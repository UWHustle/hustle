** Set bit pgno of the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. This is called

** bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding
** free-list leaf pages:
**
**   1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes
**      a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database
**      (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data). Sometimes
**      such a page is not even journalled (as it will not be modified,
**      why bother journalling it?).
**
**   2) When a free-list leaf page is reused, its content is not read
**      from the database or written to the journal file (why should it
**      be, if it is not at all meaningful?).
**
** By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy
** performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations. However, if
** a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same
** transaction, a problem comes up. If the page is not journalled when
** it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it
** is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data
** may be lost. In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible
** to restore the database to its original configuration.
**
** The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. Whenever a page is 
** moved to become a free-list leaf page, the corresponding bit is
** set in the bitvec. Whenever a leaf page is extracted from the free-list,
** optimization 2 above is omitted if the corresponding bit is already

**
**     *pRes>0      The cursor is left pointing at an entry that
**                  is larger than intKey/pIdxKey.

**
** The cells in this array are the divider cell or cells from the pParent
** page plus up to three child pages.  There are a total of nCell cells.
**
** pRef is a pointer to one of the pages that contributes cells.  This is
** used to access information such as MemPage.intKey and MemPage.pBt->pageSize
** which should be common to all pages that contribute cells to this array.
**
** apCell[] and szCell[] hold, respectively, pointers to the start of each
** cell and the size of each cell.  Some of the apCell[] pointers might refer
** to overflow cells.  In other words, some apCel[] pointers might not point
** to content area of the pages.
**
** A szCell[] of zero means the size of that cell has not yet been computed.
**
** The cells come from as many as four different pages:
**
**             -----------
**             | Parent  |
**             -----------
**            /     |     \
**           /      |      \
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**  |Child-1|   |Child-2|   |Child-3|
**  ---------   ---------   ---------
**
** The order of cells is in the array is for an index btree is:
**
**       1.  All cells from Child-1 in order
**       2.  The first divider cell from Parent
**       3.  All cells from Child-2 in order
**       4.  The second divider cell from Parent
**       5.  All cells from Child-3 in order
**
** For a table-btree (with rowids) the items 2 and 4 are empty because
** content exists only in leaves and there are no divider cells.
**
** For an index btree, the apEnd[] array holds pointer to the end of page
** for Child-1, the Parent, Child-2, the Parent (again), and Child-3,
** respectively. The ixNx[] array holds the number of cells contained in
** each of these 5 stages, and all stages to the left.  Hence:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 plus 1 for first divider.
**    ixNx[2] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + 1 for 1st divider.
**    ixNx[3] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2 + both divider cells
**    ixNx[4] = Total number of cells.
**
** For a table-btree, the concept is similar, except only apEnd[0]..apEnd[2]
** are used and they point to the leaf pages only, and the ixNx value are:
**
**    ixNx[0] = Number of cells in Child-1.
**    ixNx[1] = Number of cells in Child-1 and Child-2.
**    ixNx[2] = Total number of cells.
**
** Sometimes when deleting, a child page can have zero cells.  In those
** cases, ixNx[] entries with higher indexes, and the corresponding apEnd[]
** entries, shift down.  The end result is that each ixNx[] entry should

/*
** This routine redistributes cells on the iParentIdx'th child of pParent
** (hereafter "the page") and up to 2 siblings so that all pages have about the
** same amount of free space. Usually a single sibling on either side of the
** page are used in the balancing, though both siblings might come from one
** side if the page is the first or last child of its parent. If the page 
** has fewer than 2 siblings (something which can only happen if the page
** is a root page or a child of a root page) then all available siblings
** participate in the balancing.
**
** The number of siblings of the page might be increased or decreased by 
** one or two in an effort to keep pages nearly full but not over full. 
**
** Note that when this routine is called, some of the cells on the page
** might not actually be stored in MemPage.aData[]. This can happen
** if the page is overfull. This routine ensures that all cells allocated
** to the page and its siblings fit into MemPage.aData[] before returning.
**
** In the course of balancing the page and its siblings, cells may be
** inserted into or removed from the parent page (pParent). Doing so
** may cause the parent page to become overfull or underfull. If this
** happens, it is the responsibility of the caller to invoke the correct
** balancing routine to fix this problem (see the balance() routine). 
**
** If this routine fails for any reason, it might leave the database
** in a corrupted state. So if this routine fails, the database should
** be rolled back.
**
** The third argument to this function, aOvflSpace, is a pointer to a
** buffer big enough to hold one page. If while inserting cells into the parent
** page (pParent) the parent page becomes overfull, this buffer is
** used to store the parent's overflow cells. Because this function inserts
** a maximum of four divider cells into the parent page, and the maximum
** size of a cell stored within an internal node is always less than 1/4
** of the page-size, the aOvflSpace[] buffer is guaranteed to be large
** enough for all overflow cells.
**
** If aOvflSpace is set to a null pointer, this function returns 
** SQLITE_NOMEM.

**
**     * Via the sqlite3_backup_XXX() API function backup_step() and

**       handle mutex and the mutex associated with the source BtShared 
**       structure, in that order.
**
**     * Via the BackupUpdate() and BackupRestart() functions, which are
**       invoked by the pager layer to report various state changes in
**       the page cache associated with the source database. The mutex
**       associated with the source database BtShared structure will always 
**       be held when either of these functions are invoked.
**
**   The other sqlite3_backup_XXX() API functions, backup_remaining() and
**   backup_pagecount() are not thread-safe functions. If they are called
**   while some other thread is calling backup_step() or backup_finish(),
**   the values returned may be invalid. There is no way for a call to
**   BackupUpdate() or BackupRestart() to interfere with backup_remaining()
**   or backup_pagecount().
**
**   Depending on the SQLite configuration, the database handles and/or
**   the Btree objects may have their own mutexes that require locking.
**   Non-sharable Btrees (in-memory databases for example), do not have
**   associated mutexes.

** For most architectures, this is a no-op.
**
** (later):  It is reported to me that the mixed-endian problem
** on ARM7 is an issue with GCC, not with the ARM7 chip.  It seems
** that early versions of GCC stored the two words of a 64-bit
** float in the wrong order.  And that error has been propagated
** ever since.  The blame is not necessarily with GCC, though.
** GCC might have just copying the problem from a prior compiler.
** I am also told that newer versions of GCC that follow a different
** ABI get the byte order right.
**
** Developers using SQLite on an ARM7 should compile and run their
** application using -DSQLITE_DEBUG=1 at least once.  With DEBUG
** enabled, some asserts below will ensure that the byte order of
** floating point values is correct.
**
** (2007-08-30)  Frank van Vugt has studied this problem closely
** and has send his findings to the SQLite developers.  Frank
** writes that some Linux kernels offer floating point hardware
** emulation that uses only 32-bit mantissas instead of a full 
** 48-bits as required by the IEEE standard.  (This is the
** CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE option.)  On such systems, floating point
** byte swapping becomes very complicated.  To avoid problems,
** the necessary byte swapping is carried out using a 64-bit integer
** rather than a 64-bit float.  Frank assures us that the code here
** works for him.  We, the developers, have no way to independently
** verify this, but Frank seems to know what he is talking about
** so we trust him.

/*****************************************************************************
** What follows is a massive switch statement where each case implements a
** separate instruction in the virtual machine.  If we follow the usual
** indentation conventions, each case should be indented by 6 spaces.  But
** that is a lot of wasted space on the left margin.  So the code within
** the switch statement will break with convention and be flush-left. Another
** big comment (similar to this one) will mark the point in the code where
** we transition back to normal indentation.
**
** The formatting of each case is important.  The makefile for SQLite
** generates two C files "opcodes.h" and "opcodes.c" by scanning this
** file looking for lines that begin with "case OP_".  The opcodes.h files
** will be filled with #defines that give unique integer values to each
** opcode and the opcodes.c file is filled with an array of strings where
** each string is the symbolic name for the corresponding opcode.  If the
** case statement is followed by a comment of the form "/# same as ... #/"
** that comment is used to determine the particular value of the opcode.
**
** Other keywords in the comment that follows each case are used to
** construct the OPFLG_INITIALIZER value that initializes opcodeProperty[].
** Keywords include: in1, in2, in3, out2, out3.  See
** the mkopcodeh.awk script for additional information.
**
** Documentation about VDBE opcodes is generated by scanning this file
** for lines of that contain "Opcode:".  That line and all subsequent
** comment lines are used in the generation of the opcode.html documentation
** file.
**
** SUMMARY:
**
**     Formatting is important to scripts that scan this file.
**     Do not deviate from the formatting style currently in use.

** SQLITE_AFF_TEXT, SQLITE_AFF_INTEGER, and so forth. An attempt is made 
** to coerce both inputs according to this affinity before the
** comparison is made. If the SQLITE_AFF_MASK is 0x00, then numeric
** affinity is used. Note that the affinity conversions are stored
** back into the input registers P1 and P3.  So this opcode can cause
** persistent changes to registers P1 and P3.
**
** Once any conversions have taken place, and neither value is NULL, 
** the values are compared. If both values are blobs then memcmp() is
** used to determine the results of the comparison.  If both values
** are text, then the appropriate collating function specified in
** P4 is  used to do the comparison.  If P4 is not specified then
** memcmp() is used to compare text string.  If both values are
** numeric, then a numeric comparison is used. If the two values
** are of different types, then numbers are considered less than
** strings and strings are considered less than blobs.

** This file contains code for the VdbeSorter object, used in concert with
** a VdbeCursor to sort large numbers of keys for CREATE INDEX statements
** or by SELECT statements with ORDER BY clauses that cannot be satisfied
** using indexes and without LIMIT clauses.
**
** The VdbeSorter object implements a multi-threaded external merge sort
** algorithm that is efficient even if the number of elements being sorted
** exceeds the available memory.
**
** Here is the (internal, non-API) interface between this module and the
** rest of the SQLite system:
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterInit()       Create a new VdbeSorter object.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterWrite()      Add a single new row to the VdbeSorter
**                                  object.  The row is a binary blob in the
**                                  OP_MakeRecord format that contains both
**                                  the ORDER BY key columns and result columns
**                                  in the case of a SELECT w/ ORDER BY, or
**                                  the complete record for an index entry
**                                  in the case of a CREATE INDEX.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterRewind()     Sort all content previously added.
**                                  Position the read cursor on the
**                                  first sorted element.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterNext()       Advance the read cursor to the next sorted
**                                  element.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterRowkey()     Return the complete binary blob for the
**                                  row currently under the read cursor.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterCompare()    Compare the binary blob for the row
**                                  currently under the read cursor against
**                                  another binary blob X and report if
**                                  X is strictly less than the read cursor.
**                                  Used to enforce uniqueness in a
**                                  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterClose()      Close the VdbeSorter object and reclaim
**                                  all resources.
**
**    sqlite3VdbeSorterReset()      Refurbish the VdbeSorter for reuse.  This
**                                  is like Close() followed by Init() only
**                                  much faster.
**
** The interfaces above must be called in a particular order.  Write() can 
** only occur in between Init()/Reset() and Rewind().  Next(), Rowkey(), and
** Compare() can only occur in between Rewind() and Close()/Reset(). i.e.
**
**   Init()
**   for each record: Write()
**   Rewind()
**     Rowkey()/Compare()
**   Next() 
**   Close()
**
** Algorithm:
**
** Records passed to the sorter via calls to Write() are initially held 
** unsorted in main memory. Assuming the amount of memory used never exceeds
** a threshold, when Rewind() is called the set of records is sorted using
** an in-memory merge sort. In this case, no temporary files are required
** and subsequent calls to Rowkey(), Next() and Compare() read records 
** directly from main memory.
**
** If the amount of space used to store records in main memory exceeds the
** threshold, then the set of records currently in memory are sorted and
** written to a temporary file in "Packed Memory Array" (PMA) format.
** A PMA created at this point is known as a "level-0 PMA". Higher levels
** of PMAs may be created by merging existing PMAs together - for example
** merging two or more level-0 PMAs together creates a level-1 PMA.
**
** The threshold for the amount of main memory to use before flushing 
** records to a PMA is roughly the same as the limit configured for the
** page-cache of the main database. Specifically, the threshold is set to 
** the value returned by "PRAGMA main.page_size" multipled by 
** that returned by "PRAGMA main.cache_size", in bytes.
**
** If the sorter is running in single-threaded mode, then all PMAs generated
** are appended to a single temporary file. Or, if the sorter is running in
** multi-threaded mode then up to (N+1) temporary files may be opened, where
** N is the configured number of worker threads. In this case, instead of
** sorting the records and writing the PMA to a temporary file itself, the
** calling thread usually launches a worker thread to do so. Except, if
** there are already N worker threads running, the main thread does the work
** itself.
**
** The sorter is running in multi-threaded mode if (a) the library was built
** with pre-processor symbol SQLITE_MAX_WORKER_THREADS set to a value greater
** than zero, and (b) worker threads have been enabled at runtime by calling
** "PRAGMA threads=N" with some value of N greater than 0.
**
** When Rewind() is called, any data remaining in memory is flushed to a 
** final PMA. So at this point the data is stored in some number of sorted
** PMAs within temporary files on disk.
**
** If there are fewer than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs in total and the
** sorter is running in single-threaded mode, then these PMAs are merged
** incrementally as keys are retreived from the sorter by the VDBE.  The
** MergeEngine object, described in further detail below, performs this
** merge.
**
** Or, if running in multi-threaded mode, then a background thread is
** launched to merge the existing PMAs. Once the background thread has
** merged T bytes of data into a single sorted PMA, the main thread 
** begins reading keys from that PMA while the background thread proceeds
** with merging the next T bytes of data. And so on.
**
** Parameter T is set to half the value of the memory threshold used 
** by Write() above to determine when to create a new PMA.
**
** If there are more than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs in total when 
** Rewind() is called, then a hierarchy of incremental-merges is used. 
** First, T bytes of data from the first SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs on 
** disk are merged together. Then T bytes of data from the second set, and
** so on, such that no operation ever merges more than SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT
** PMAs at a time. This done is to improve locality.
**
** If running in multi-threaded mode and there are more than
** SORTER_MAX_MERGE_COUNT PMAs on disk when Rewind() is called, then more
** than one background thread may be created. Specifically, there may be
** one background thread for each temporary file on disk, and one background
** thread to merge the output of each of the others to a single PMA for
** the main thread to read from.

**
** The aReadr[] array contains a PmaReader object for each of the PMAs being
** merged.  An aReadr[] object either points to a valid key or else is at EOF.
** ("EOF" means "End Of File".  When aReadr[] is at EOF there is no more data.)
** For the purposes of the paragraphs below, we assume that the array is
** actually N elements in size, where N is the smallest power of 2 greater
** to or equal to the number of PMAs being merged. The extra aReadr[] elements
** are treated as if they are empty (always at EOF).
**
** The aTree[] array is also N elements in size. The value of N is stored in
** the MergeEngine.nTree variable.
**
** The final (N/2) elements of aTree[] contain the results of comparing
** pairs of PMA keys together. Element i contains the result of 
** comparing aReadr[2*i-N] and aReadr[2*i-N+1]. Whichever key is smaller, the
** aTree element is set to the index of it. 
**
** For the purposes of this comparison, EOF is considered greater than any
** other key value. If the keys are equal (only possible with two EOF
** values), it doesn't matter which index is stored.
**
** The (N/4) elements of aTree[] that precede the final (N/2) described 
** above contains the index of the smallest of each block of 4 PmaReaders
** And so on. So that aTree[1] contains the index of the PmaReader that 
** currently points to the smallest key value. aTree[0] is unused.
**
** Example:
**
**     aReadr[0] -> Banana
**     aReadr[1] -> Feijoa
**     aReadr[2] -> Elderberry
**     aReadr[3] -> Currant
**     aReadr[4] -> Grapefruit
**     aReadr[5] -> Apple
**     aReadr[6] -> Durian
**     aReadr[7] -> EOF
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 5   0, 5    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** The current element is "Apple" (the value of the key indicated by 
** PmaReader 5). When the Next() operation is invoked, PmaReader 5 will
** be advanced to the next key in its segment. Say the next key is
** "Eggplant":
**
**     aReadr[5] -> Eggplant
**
** The contents of aTree[] are updated first by comparing the new PmaReader
** 5 key to the current key of PmaReader 4 (still "Grapefruit"). The PmaReader
** 5 value is still smaller, so aTree[6] is set to 5. And so on up the tree.
** The value of PmaReader 6 - "Durian" - is now smaller than that of PmaReader
** 5, so aTree[3] is set to 6. Key 0 is smaller than key 6 (Banana<Durian),
** so the value written into element 1 of the array is 0. As follows:
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 0   0, 6    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** In other words, each time we advance to the next sorter element, log2(N)
** key comparison operations are required, where N is the number of segments
** being merged (rounded up to the next power of 2).

** Normally, a PmaReader object iterates through an existing PMA stored 
** within a temp file. However, if the PmaReader.pIncr variable points to
** an object of the following type, it may be used to iterate/merge through
** multiple PMAs simultaneously.
**
** There are two types of IncrMerger object - single (bUseThread==0) and 
** multi-threaded (bUseThread==1). 
**
** A multi-threaded IncrMerger object uses two temporary files - aFile[0] 
** and aFile[1]. Neither file is allowed to grow to more than mxSz bytes in 
** size. When the IncrMerger is initialized, it reads enough data from 
** pMerger to populate aFile[0]. It then sets variables within the 
** corresponding PmaReader object to read from that file and kicks off 
** a background thread to populate aFile[1] with the next mxSz bytes of 
** sorted record data from pMerger. 
**
** When the PmaReader reaches the end of aFile[0], it blocks until the
** background thread has finished populating aFile[1]. It then exchanges
** the contents of the aFile[0] and aFile[1] variables within this structure,
** sets the PmaReader fields to read from the new aFile[0] and kicks off
** another background thread to populate the new aFile[1]. And so on, until
** the contents of pMerger are exhausted.
**
** A single-threaded IncrMerger does not open any temporary files of its
** own. Instead, it has exclusive access to mxSz bytes of space beginning
** at offset iStartOff of file pTask->file2. And instead of using a 
** background thread to prepare data for the PmaReader, with a single
** threaded IncrMerger the allocate part of pTask->file2 is "refilled" with
** keys from pMerger by the calling thread whenever the PmaReader runs out
** of data.

** Initialize the temporary index cursor just opened as a sorter cursor.
**
** Usually, the sorter module uses the value of (pCsr->pKeyInfo->nKeyField)
** to determine the number of fields that should be compared from the
** records being sorted. However, if the value passed as argument nField
** is non-zero and the sorter is able to guarantee a stable sort, nField
** is used instead. This is used when sorting records for a CREATE INDEX
** statement. In this case, keys are always delivered to the sorter in
** order of the primary key, which happens to be make up the final part 
** of the records being sorted. So if the sort is stable, there is never
** any reason to compare PK fields and they can be ignored for a small
** performance boost.
**
** The sorter can guarantee a stable sort when running in single-threaded
** mode, but not in multi-threaded mode.
**
** SQLITE_OK is returned if successful, or an SQLite error code otherwise.
