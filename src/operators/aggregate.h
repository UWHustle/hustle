 * Group = a set of column values, one for each column in the GROUP BY clause

 *
 * Initialize an empty output table T
 * Fetch all the unique value of each column in the GROUP BY clause
 *
 * Iterate over all possible groups G:
 *   Get a filter for each column value in G
 *   Logically AND all the filters (1)
 *   Apply the filter to the aggregate column
 *   If the filtered aggregate column has positive length:
 *      Compute the aggregate over the filtered column
 *      Insert the tuple (G, aggregate) into T
 *
 * If the aggregate column appears in the ORDER BY clause:
 *   Sort T with as specified by the ORDER BY clause
 *
 * (1) The resulting filter corresponds to all rows of the table that are part
 * of group G
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * R =
 * group1 | group2 | data
 *   A    |   a    |  1
 *   A    |   a    |  10
 *   A    |   b    |  100
 *   B    |   b    |  1000
 *
 * SELECT group1, group2, sum(data)
 * FROM R
 * GROUP BY group1, group2
 *
 * All possible groups: (A, a), (A, b), (B, a), (B, b)
 *
 * For group (A, a):
 * group1 filter = [1, 1, 1, 0]
 * group2 filter = [1, 1, 0, 0]
 * group (A, a) filter = [1, 1, 0, 0]
 *
 * data after applying group (A, a) filter = [1, 10]
 * result tuple = (A, a, 11)
 *
 * Group (B, a) does not exist in R. The group (B, a) filter is [0, 0, 0, 0],
 * which means the filtered aggregate column with have length 0. Thus, this
 * group will be excluded from the output.
