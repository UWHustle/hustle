# Hustle
Hustle is an efficient data platform, organized as a collection of data processing kernels, based on a micro services architecture, serving heterogeneous application query languages that map to core relational algebraic DSL

## Building blocks
Hustle is built on [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow). 

## Coding Guidelinees
We follow [these guidelines](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/cpp/development.html).


## Build Hustle

To install the required packages for Hustle use the following scripts:

```
./install_requirements.sh
./install_arrow.sh
```
The scripts will install g++9, cmake 3.15 and Apache Arrow.

Then use cmake to build Hustle:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG .. 
make -j<number of cores>
```

To run the test go into the build directory and use:
```
ctest --output-on-failure
```
